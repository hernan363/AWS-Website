            <b><h2>What am I looking for in my next opportunity?</b></h2><br>
            I'm looking for a team that has proven to produce an intuitive, and well designed product.<br>
            I know I have much to learn going forward, and want to make sure I stay up to date with industry best practices. <br>
            I would like to be in a remote position since I see myself moving cities in the future.

            <br><br>

            <b><h2>Where do I see myself in 5 years?</b></h2><br>
            I see myself working on a product that I can personally use and interact with.<br>
            I'm invested in making the product the best it can be, and enjoy watching others use it.<br>
            I see myself growing as an engineer and challenging myself everyday. <br>
            I'm taking on leadership roles and passing down the patience and knowledge that what was given to me. <br>
